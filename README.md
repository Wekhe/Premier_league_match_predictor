## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Historical match results and team stats are collected from public football datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   The model extracts meaningful metrics such as:
   - Home/Away team form
   - Goals scored & conceded averages
   - Win/Loss streaks
   - Head-to-head performance

3. **Model Training**  
   A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost) is trained and tuned for best accuracy.

4. **Prediction**  
   Input two teams, and the model outputs:
   - **Home Win**
   - **Draw**
   - **Away Win**
